A brief "Project Review" presentation will be delivered ( to the Gradebook and posted publicly in the discussion board) from each group.  Here you should at least have completed:

1. A update to the prototype of what your finished project will look like with a mock up of how it will behave.
2. An updated time line of the project responsibilities and who is accountable for each.

3. A presentation of the heirarchy of the API you are working with - either as a UML diagram or by taking us through the Javadoc site. Be on the lookout to emphasize for us examples of inheritance, and polymorphism in its design.
 
4. Tour of any code written and tested to date. Please identify any specific feature of the code that teaches a new programming idea, something we as a class have not yet seen.

The final version of the project will be presented before the last day of the term. At that time submit the written documentation,  a video tour of the working application and its code, and the complete well-commented code.
